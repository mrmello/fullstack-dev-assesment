Considerations
----------
### Assumptions
 - It was assumed that the database should not persist. As mentioned in the task it could be prepopulated every time.
 - The log's view for the api is not optimized as the ideal strategy is to use the ELK Stack. However I couldn't get it working in time on my only dev machine, I had problems causing the mongodb to run out of memory and going swap.
